		<h3>Bio</h3>
		<p>Rick Reilly is a screenwriter, book author, keynote speaker and member of the National Sportswriters and Sportscasters Hall of Fame. He was voted National Sportswriter of the Year 11 times over a career that began in 1979. He is the author of 13 books, including “Meet My Sister … And Other Things I Probably Shouldn’t Have Said,” a collection of his best columns written at ESPN, with postscript updates of each column at the bottom and “Who’s Your Caddy?” (Doubleday), about Reilly caddying for everyone from Jack Nicklaus to Donald Trump to a $50,000-a-hole gambler. It rose to No. 3 on the New York Times bestseller list. His most recent book, “Commander-in-Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump,” is an uproarious indictment of President Donald Trump. It was #6 with a bullet in its first week on The New York Times bestseller list. For two years, he was the host of ESPN’s Homecoming with Rick Reilly, a one-hour interview show.<br></p>
		<p>
		On June 10, 2014, he wrote his final column as a sportswriter. The next year, he produced his last TV piece for ESPN. He now writes sitcoms, screenplays, and books in Hollywood. He currently has two movies in development. Reilly won the 2009 Damon Runyon Award for Outstanding Contributions to Journalism. Reilly is the founder of the anti-malaria effort, “Nothing But Nets,” which has raised more than $60 million to provide mosquito nets for children in Africa where 2,000 children die every day of the disease—a partnership with the United Nations Foundation—with every dollar goes to buying the nets.

		<h3>Bio</h3>
		<p>Shep & Ian Murray are CEOs and founders of vineyard vines and brothers who grew up in Connecticut and spent every summer on Martha's Vineyard. As youth, they played in various bands, recorded albums, started assorted small businesses and would combine earnings to buy the “best old boat” they could find to head out on the water and escape life from time to time. In the late nineties, both were unhappy at their respective Manhattan jobs, so they decided to trade in business suits for bathing suits by selling ties. Before quitting their jobs, they leased cars and signed up for credit cards to start their new business. Their first 800 ties hit the market in 1998 and sold out in the first week. Continued success allowed them to grow quickly, expand, hire staff, and open stores across the country. Today, they work from a brand-new office, sell more items than ties, have a new golf team, and are the official style of the Kentucky Derby.</p>
